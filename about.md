I think of biking a century as a fun Saturday activity and tied the age-group record of 178 miles in 12 hours at Ohio’s Calvin’s Challenge bicycle race in 2006. I’ve also been known to climb stairs competitively and hold a PR of 15:38s at Chicago’s annual Hustle Up the Hancock — that’s 104.4 stairs per minute, baby!

I’m also a little quantification obsessed. Check out

I gave at the 
[NYC Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/ "People self experimenting and talking about what they learned") meetup in 2010.
And [this one](https://vimeo.com/82754631 "Beeminding Beeminder") in 2013.
And [this one](http://quantifiedself.com/2016/02/bethany-soule-extreme-productivity/ "Maniac Productivity") in 2016.
